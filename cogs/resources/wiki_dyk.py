  '... that an O(sqrt(log(t))) pattern was constructed in 2010, with a diameter that grows at the slowest possible asymptotic ("big O") rate for any Life pattern?',
  '... that since the first Cordership was assembled from 13 switch engines in 1991, the number of switch engines required has gradually decreased, with a 2-engine Cordership finally making its appearance in 2017?',
  '... that the bounding box and recovery time of the current fastest stable reflector, Mike Playle\'s Snark, are both more than two full orders of magnitude smaller than the first stable reflector, constructed by Paul Callahan in 1996?',
  '... that as of 2019, no elementary replicators have been found in Life?',
  '... that while multiple c/12 diagonal spaceships are known, none are true period?',
  '... that the first p23 oscillator, David Hilbert, was created as a modification of a "troll" pattern posted a week earlier?',
  '... that exactly two years after a fake loafer-producing soup was posted to the forums on April Fools\' Day, a real soup was found on April 1, 2020?',
  '... patterns have been constructed whose fate is currently unknown (based on the twin primes and Collatz conjectures)?',
  '... a pattern of 44 cells exists whose population grows by exactly one cell each generation?',
  '... it is possible to send a signal from one side to the other of an infinite diagonal line of cells without destroying the line?',
  '... there are \'Heisenburp\' reactions which can detect the passage of a glider without affecting it in any way?',
  '... Corderships can be constructed using individual switch engines placed arbitrarily far from each other, that will still support each other using intermediary gliders and stable objects?',
  '... fuses can be made that burn arbitrarily slowly, based on sending spaceships back and forth between two rows of stable objects?',
  '... there exist \'lone dot\' agars consisting of isolated cells in every generation?',
  '... that some types of spaceship, but not all, support stable Heisenburp technology, where an arrangement of still lifes detects the passage of the spaceship, emits a signal, and returns to its original state?',
  '... that, while it is impossible to build a true stable Heisenburp device that detects a passing glider without even temporarily affecting it, there are several known stable pseudo-Heisenburp devices?',
  '... that the name of the Bandersnatch, a color-changing lane-shifter device discovered in 2020, is derived from a Lewis Carroll poem that also supplied names for the Snark, the boojum reflector, and the Bellman search utility?',
  '... that the first rake that produces spaceships travelling in the same direction but slower was found in 2003, using a c/2 rake to produce 2c/5 spaceships?',
  '... that it is possible for a single Life object to simulate the evolution of an arbitrary number of other Life objects at the same time (although at increasingly slower speeds)?',
  '... that the Fast Forward Force Field reaction can transport an LWSS 11 spaces in 6 generations, creating the illusion of super-light-speed travel?',
  '... that there are line puffers with a row of live cells at the back, which create very dirty exhaust whose period apparently (this is not proven) grows exponentially as the length of the row is increased?',
  '... that there is an infinite series of period 3 oscillators that are polyominoes in one phase, starting with the cross?',
  '... that there are spaceships without any sparks which can nevertheless perturb objects due to their ability to repair some damage to themselves?',
  '... that the R-pentomino creates a queen bee shuttle in generation 774, which lasts 17 generations before being destroyed?',
  '... that a relay glider bouncing back and forth between two pentadecathlons was one of the earliest constructive proofs that oscillators can have arbitrarily high periods?',
  '... that there are spacefiller patterns that grow quadratically to fill space with an agar with density 1/2 (zebra stripes)?',
  '... that a row of appropriately placed traffic lights is one of the few known wicks that can be extended by "pushing" from its stationary end?',
  '... that space nonfiller patterns have been constructed that expand to affect the entire Life plane, leaving an expanding region of vacuum at their center?',
  '... that there exist non-monotonic spaceships, even some with period as low as 3, whose leading edges fall back in at least one generation.',
  '... that some periodic objects -- e.g., a pentadecathlon hassled by period-7 pipsquirters -- can be perturbed to cause them to skip forwards by one or more phases in their cycle?',
  '... that more stable seed constellations for moving objects were completed in 2020 than in all preceding years put together?'
